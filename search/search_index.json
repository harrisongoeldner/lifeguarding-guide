Sure you will find some information in the Lifesaving Society's Alert Lifeguarding manual. But I've personally found that most of the information is pretty vague. </p> <p>It does have some pretty interesting stuff regarding the general principles of lifeguarding. But when it comes to practical application and first aid skills. If definetely lacking.</p> <p>Most of what you learn comes from actual instructors. What I found is that I'd learn it for a course and then quickly forget it. Too often I wouldn't take notes so would be guessing to what the answer is. Often relearning something many times over. Unless you're applying something on a daily basis, you're gonna forget. </p> <p>The other issue is that most lifeguarding courses assume you learned all your first aid skills from your standard first aid course. Theoretically they should be teaching you the full scene and primary survey and how to apply it. The reality is often they dumb it down as most people are not gonna need all the details. Most people take it simply because their job requires the certification. </p> <p>The unfortunate result for the future lifeguard is that their first aid education is greatly lacking. Well this is what I am hoping to solve. I want to combine general lifeguarding principles with their applications. Think of this guide as your handy cheat sheet.</p>"},{"location":"#about-the-author","title":"About the author","text":"<p>Hi \ud83d\udc4b, I am Harrison.

You will be dealing with high stakes situations and need to be able to react and make decisions without hesitation. Luckily for you the lifesaving society has estabilished a set of guidelines and principles for you to follow. </p> <p>In recent years the lifesaving society has been moving away from a strictly rule base approach to a principle based approach. The rational is to allow to you deal with a more wide variety of first aid situations. The cons being that there is more gray area over what you should do. </p> <p>The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone. When starting your first job, you will be supported. You don't need to know all the answers. Overtime you will develop a gut intuition regarding what you should do.</p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/#prevention","title":"Prevention","text":"<p>The core tenent of lifeguarding is prevention. Your primary goal is to prevent most incidents from happening. This comes in the form of enforcing pool rules and also reconizing situations that could lead to an incident. Most experienced lifeguards can prevent most near drownings by regonizing weak swimmers and directing them accordingly. </p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/#scanning","title":"Scanning","text":"<p>This is the majority of what you will be doing as a lifeguard. You are an active observer of the pool (remember prevention!). The lifesaving society establishes the 30 second rule. Your entire zone must be scanned within 30 seconds. This includes blind spots. Essentially if someone starts to drown or a medical emergency occurs it is your job to ensure it is spotted within 30 seconds. </p> <p>This is typically achieved by a scanning and roaming pattern. Some pools establish a fixed roaming pattern. Others leave it up to the discretion of the guard. There are three scanning patterns, star burst, zig zag, and arc. </p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/#scene-primary-and-secondary-survey","title":"Scene, Primary, and Secondary Survey","text":"<p>Every incident you encounter as a lifeguard should begin with the scene survey, followed by the primary and seconary surveys. These surveys are critical for ensuring that you do not miss any steps. As you become more familiar with the survey, sometimes certain actions can be done simultaneously or the order modified as needed. For instance, if the person says they are having trouble breathing, you can pull some questions from your secondary survey to narrow it down (e.g., medical history, events prior). </p> <p>The key term to remember is priority action approach. You deal with the most severe and life threatening issues first. Okay, let\u2019s begin. </p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/#remember-911-is-your-best-friend","title":"Remember 911 is Your Best Friend","text":"<p>Something a lot of new guards get caught up over is whether to call EMS. </p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/drowning-care/","title":"Drowning Care","text":""},{"location":"lifeguarding/oxygen-administration/","title":"Oxygen Administration","text":"<p>95% and above is A+ meaning no oxygen needed</p> <p>You give oxygen regardless for\u2026  </p> <ol> <li>Ra - respiratory arrest  </li> <li>Bends - decompression sickness  </li> <li>Carbon monoxide poisoning  </li> <li>Drowning - fluid in lungs  </li> <li>Re - respiratory emergencies with no prior cardiovascular signs and symptoms </li> </ol> <p>Do not give oxygen to heart attack if oxygen is 95% of above.

Removals from the Water","text":"<p>A large part of guarding is removing people from the water. If you wanted to fit this into the PAA it would often fit into the Scene Survey. You assess hazards/history to determine D-spine. Based on that you respond and remove from the water. Then you double check that history and put on PPE.</p> <p>For unconscience spinals however you pull some parts of the primary survey into the removal by assessing breathing. The point is that aquatic related specifics often happen as part of the PAA.</p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/priority-action-approach/#2-minor-injuries","title":"2. Minor Injuries","text":"<p>Most facilities have separate forms for minors and majors. Minor injuries are often assessed as a mini version of the full PAA. Examples of this would be cuts, nose bleeds, etc. It would often be overkill to go through the full secondary survey in these scenarios. If they are talking and breathing with a papercut for instance you can pretty quickly check off most of the things in the primary survey as fine. When you are new it can be helpful to individually go through the survey in your head but with experience it becomes second nature. </p>"},{"location":"lifeguarding/priority-action-approach/#3-pulling-questions-from-the-secondary-survey-into-the-primary","title":"3.
