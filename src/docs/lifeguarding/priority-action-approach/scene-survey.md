# Scene Survey

The scene survey is your initial assessment of the situation. You are trying to figure out **how** did this happen and are there any **hazards** to my person.

Recall the three steps of the scene survey are:

1. Hazards  
2. History/bystanders ‚û° D-spine?
3. PPE

### **Step 1 ‚û° Hazards**

Identify hazards you can see visually as you approach. In a lifeguarding context of a pool this is more of a controlled environment so you likely know the hazards. However there could be some unknowns: do you see needles, exposed electrical equipment, etc. These hazards can also inform you on your response and treatment of the victim.

### **Step 2 ‚û° History**

Your next step is determining the history of what happened to cause the first aid incident:

* üëã If the victim is **conscience** this could be as simple asking the questions *"what's wrong and how did this happen?"*  
* üòµ If they are **unconscience** this could ask a bystander *"hey did you see what happened?"*

If the mechanism of injury could indicate a spinal, follow up with does your neck hurt? Do you feel any tingling? If the mechanism is severe and they have any symptoms of a spinal proceed with the appropriate spinal procedure. Remember that if you don't know the mechanism of injury it is better to be safe than sorry.

*Example 1:* Timmy is unconscience in the deep end by the diving boards. You didn't see what happened.

*Response:* You don't know what happened but there is a possibility that he injured his spine. Therefore you are going to flatboard him as a precaution.

*Example 2:* Timmy is unconscience in the deep end by the diving boards. You saw him practicing holding his breath 5 seconds before.

*Response:* It would be reasonable to assume he just passed out. Therefore spinal protocol is not necessary.

*Example 3:* Timmy was sitting in the hot tub. You find him unconscience.

*Response:* This would be at your discretion. If you suspect he hit his neck than it could be a spinal. However the likely culprit if sitting in the hot tub is he passed out.

### **Step 3 ‚û° PPE**

‚ÄºÔ∏è Put on your **personal protective equipment** (PPE)! Do **NOT** forget this step!

This is most commonly putting on gloves. Remember that you cannot do your job effectively if you get a disease or injured from a first aid.
