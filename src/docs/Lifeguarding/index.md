# Introduction

Lifeguarding is a both a rewarding and stressful job. You will be dealing with high stakes situations and need to be able to react and make decisions without hesitation. Luckily for you the lifesaving society has estabilished a set of guidelines and principles for you to follow. 

In recent years the lifesaving society has been moving away from a strictly rule base approach to a principle based approach. The rational is to allow to you deal with a more wide variety of first aid situations. The cons being that there is more gray area over what you should do. 

The most important thing to remember is that you are not alone. When starting your first job, you will be supported. You don't need to know all the answers. Overtime you will develop a gut intuition regarding what you should do.

## Scene, Primary, and Secondary Survey

Every incident you encounter as a lifeguard should begin with the scene survey, followed by the primary and seconary surveys. These surveys are critical for ensuring that you do not miss any steps. As you become more familiar with the survey, sometimes certain actions can be done simultaneously or the order modified as needed. For instance, if the person says they are having trouble breathing, you can pull some questions from your secondary survey to narrow it down (e.g., medical history, events prior). 

The key term to remember is *priority action approach*. You deal with the most severe and life threatening issues first. Okay, letâ€™s begin.
