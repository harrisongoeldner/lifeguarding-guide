# Lifeguarding

Priority action approach 

## Primary Survey

Hazards
History/bystanders -> D-spine

PPE

LOC

  - Alert?
  - Verbal?
  - Pain?
  - Unconscious?


**A**irway  
**B**reathing  
**C**irculation  

Distal (sort of part of circulation)
- Spinal, external limb injuries must be checked - for spinals both hands both feet
- Wrapping check before and after

Critical Interventions!
- AED?
- 911?
- Deadly bleeding, cardiac arrest treatment etc. 
Rapid body survey? (e.g., big picture, anything else wrong?)

Shock Treatment
Warmth
Oxygen admin
Position comfort 
Rest and reassurance

Oxygen Administration (part of primary)

95% and above is A+ meaning no oxygen needed

You give oxygen regardless for…
1. Ra - respiratory arrest
2. Bends - decompression sickness
3. Carbon monoxide poisoning 
4. Drowning - fluid in lungs
5. Re - respiratory emergencies with no prior cardiovascular signs and symptoms
    - Non traumatic chest pain incident
    - Shock
    - Stroke

Do not give oxygen to heart attack

Safe Handling and Use of Oxygen Tanks
Flame
Oil and grease
Rough handling 
Damage
Storage

Secondary Survey

Order: History, vitals, head to toe

Remember! If two guards, one should do history while other does vitals. 

History
Chief complaint 
History
Allergies
Medications 
Personal information 
Pain
- Position
- Quality
- Radiating 
- Severity 
- Timing
Last meal
Events prior 

Vitals
Time 
LOC
Pulse (radial) 60-100
Respirations 10-22
Eyes - Pupils equal and reactive to light 
Skin

Head to toe

Critical Interventions

Drowning care
Assessment-2 deep breaths

Education
72hrs after incident 
1. Altered level con 
2. change behaviour 
3. Extreme tiredness/weakness 
4. Diff breathing /shortness of breath
5. Coughing
6. Wheezing
7. Nausea
8. Vomiting
9. Frothy spewdom 

Redirection / follow up

Anaphylaxis 
Epinephrine- patent expired meaning many brands
Now called auto injectors 

Things to check… 
Ownership
Expiration
Fluid colour
Contact with allergen
Call 911

2nd dose - 5minutes 

Non traumatic chest pain
Asa does not have to be theirs
Allergic or advised against
1 regular dose or two lose dosage 

Nitro
Prescription- ownership
Sexual enhancement 48 hrs
No more than 3 doses in 10 min

CPR Complications

Breaths not going in - obstructed airway, fluid, mask not sealed properly , gastric distrecitaton - open airway more or smaller breaths

Water in airway - two rescue breaths before compressions; if able give while in water. 

Sprains and strains
- just immobilize - wrapping
 
Rest
Ice
Compression
Elevate
Distal 

Fractures, breaks, dislocation
Rest
Immobilize
Cold
Elevate 
Distal

How to differentiate strain from break: ability to bear weight

Burns

Superficial or partial (1st and 2nd degree don’t call 911)
Deep (3rd degree) -> call 911
More than just hand size burn -> call 911

Chemical - check SDS
If wet, flush with water.
If dry, brush and then flush. 

Electrical - entry and exit points -> always call 911

Deadly bleeds

Rest
Elevate
Direct pressure - apply gauze, absorbent, and wrap

If first bandage soaks through, apply second. If second soaks through, pretty serious
-> tourniquet if limb

 Remember, must write time on tourniquet!

Succeeding in SITS

Situations tend to be a source of stress for lifeguard in training and those renewing their skills. However, due to the limited test applications, these tests tend to be easier than actual emergencies. 

Here are a couple important reminders:
1. Say the obvious out loud. It is easy to skim through the primary survey in our heads especially if they are alert and talking. This however, can come across to the tester that you are skipping steps. 
2. Typically situations are limited to what is covered in standard first aid. This means that there tends to be only 10-12 different first aid emergencies you can experience. Knowing this means you just have to eliminate what it isn’t and be the detective.
